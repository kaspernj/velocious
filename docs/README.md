# Velocious Docs

This folder contains implementation learnings and practical guidance discovered while building and integrating Velocious.

## Index
- `docs/frontend-models.md`: Frontend model transport, commands, lookup semantics, and pitfalls.
- `docs/frontend-model-resources.md`: Resource recipe requirements for generated frontend models.
- `docs/routing-hooks-and-autoroutes.md`: Route hook support and frontend-model autoroute behavior.
- `docs/authorization-and-current.md`: Ability usage, `Current`, and `accessible`/`accessibleBy` behavior.
- `docs/testing-guidelines.md`: Browser/system test guidance and why end-to-end coverage is preferred.

## Working Agreement
When new behavior, constraints, edge cases, or integration caveats are discovered, add/update docs in this folder in the same change so knowledge stays current.
