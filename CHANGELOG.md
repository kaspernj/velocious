# Changelog

- Infer generated frontend-model attribute JSDoc types from resource attribute metadata/column descriptors (including nullability) instead of always emitting `any`.
- Add a CanCan-style authorization library with request-scoped abilities, resource-defined `abilities()` rules, and `Model.accessible()` query filtering.
- Add `g:frontend-models` generation from `backendProjects` resource config to create `src/frontend-models/*.js` classes.
- Add a frontend model runtime base with first-iteration `find`, `update`, `destroy`, and attribute helpers.
- Add specs for frontend model generation and runtime command behavior.
- Add frontend-model `preload(...)` query chaining with nested relationship hydration from `__preloadedRelationships`, and pass preload params through built-in frontend model controller index/find actions.
- Generate typed frontend-model relationship helpers from `backendProjects.resources.*.relationships`, including belongs-to/has-one getter methods and has-many relationship helpers with `.loaded()`/`.build()`.
- Authorize nested preloaded frontend-model relationship serialization using each related model resource ability scope, and null out unauthorized singular relationships.
- Fail frontend-model generation when a configured relationship target has no corresponding frontend resource in the same backend project.
- Deny nested preload serialization for related models without frontend resource configuration when ability context is active.
- Authorize preloaded has-many nested frontend-model serialization in bulk per related model class to avoid N+1 authorization queries.
- Clear frontend-model relationship cache on attribute changes so stale preloaded relationships do not survive after updates/foreign-key changes.
- Scope nested preload authorization resource lookup to the current backend project so same-named models in other backend projects do not affect authorization.
- Authorize preloaded singular nested relationships in bulk during collection serialization to avoid per-row authorization queries.

- Bump `system-testing` from `1.0.76` to `1.0.77`.
- Inline browser `EXPO_PUBLIC_SYSTEM_TEST*` env values in the browser test bundle to prevent websocket startup failures when `process` is unavailable in the browser runtime.
- Resolve built-in controller frontend model actions (`frontendIndex`, `frontendFind`, `frontendUpdate`, `frontendDestroy`) from `backendProjects.resources` configuration so controllers no longer need a `frontendModelClass()` implementation.
- Add optional `backendProjects.resources.*.server` hooks (`beforeAction`, `records`, `serialize`, `find`, `update`, `destroy`) for backend-side customization without controller action overrides.
- Move built-in frontend model actions out of the base `Controller` class into a dedicated `FrontendModelController` class so projects opt in explicitly.
- Require `backendProjects.resources.*.abilities` for frontend model generation and runtime actions, and enforce CanCan-style action scoping via ability-aware queries (`read`, `update`, `destroy`, etc.).
- Make `Model.accessibleBy(ability)` require an explicit ability object and raise a clear error when called without one.
- Add a Rails-style `Current` API backed by async-local request context and make `Model.accessible()` resolve ability from `Current.ability()` by default.
- Improve `g:frontend-models` output JSDoc typing by generating per-model `@typedef` attribute maps and using typed getter/setter signatures (`ModelAttributes["field"]`) instead of `any`.
- Support `backendProjects[].frontendModelsOutputPath` so `g:frontend-models` can write generated files to another project directory (for example a separate frontend app).
- Auto-resolve frontend model command paths (for example `/accounts/frontend-index`) from `backendProjects.resources` even when those custom command routes are not explicitly declared in app route files.
- Add a general `routeResolverHooks` configuration API (plus `configuration.addRouteResolverHook(...)`) so libraries can hijack unresolved routes before 404 handling.
- Add Node CLI commands `db:seed`, `run-script [file-path]`, and Rails-style `runner "<javascript-code>"` with initialized app/DB context.
- Run `routeResolverHooks` before regular route matching so hooks can truly hijack routable paths (for example frontend model command endpoints that overlap resource routes).
- Add `FrontendModelBase.configureTransport(...)` with `baseUrl`/`baseUrlResolver`, `pathPrefix`/`pathPrefixResolver`, `credentials`, and custom `request` support so apps configure backend endpoint location without overriding frontend model internals.
- Add `FrontendModelBase.findBy(...)` and `FrontendModelBase.findByOrFail(...)` for generated frontend models with condition matching via `index` payloads.
- Harden frontend `findBy`/`findByOrFail` condition handling by rejecting undefined/function/symbol/bigint/non-finite values, normalizing condition serialization before matching, and supporting deep object/array equality checks.
- Make frontend `findBy`/`findByOrFail` fail fast when top-level conditions are not plain objects (for example primitives/arrays), preventing accidental broad lookups from invalid inputs.
- Normalize numeric string/number primitive comparisons in frontend `findBy` matching so conditions like `{id: 2}` match serialized backend ids like `"2"`.
- Make `test:browser` require `spec/dummy/src/config/configuration.js` explicitly and raise a clear error when the dummy backend configuration is missing.
- Harden `test:browser` backend startup by stopping partially initialized apps on startup errors and skipping dummy model initialization for browser integration backend endpoints.
- Fix frontend `findBy` condition matching for array-valued attributes by using deep array equality when both expected and actual values are arrays.
- Validate browser test runner ports (`VELOCIOUS_BROWSER_BACKEND_PORT`, `SYSTEM_TEST_HTTP_PORT`) as positive integers and normalize env values so specs and server share the same resolved ports.
- Reject symbol-keyed frontend `findBy` conditions explicitly and iterate own condition keys during validation/matching so symbol-based inputs cannot degrade into unfiltered lookups.
- Make `test:browser` skip dummy model initialization in worker-loaded backend configs via `VELOCIOUS_SKIP_DUMMY_MODEL_INITIALIZATION=1`, preventing table-dependent startup failures (for example missing `accounts`) in CI environments.
- Enforce `VELOCIOUS_SKIP_DUMMY_MODEL_INITIALIZATION=1` inside HTTP worker threads by overriding worker-loaded configuration model initialization hooks before app initialization.
- Move `VELOCIOUS_SKIP_DUMMY_MODEL_INITIALIZATION=1` handling into `Configuration.initializeModels(...)` and remove runtime method overrides in browser test startup paths.
- Make frontend `findBy` object matching exact by own-key set and value (not subset matching), so object conditions do not incorrectly match broader nested payloads.
- Log request failures with a separate cleaned backtrace block so stack frames are visible without node internals and `node_modules` noise.
- Scope `VELOCIOUS_SKIP_DUMMY_MODEL_INITIALIZATION=1` to browser test runs (`VELOCIOUS_BROWSER_TESTS=true` in test environment) so regular app/server initialization still loads models.
- Add frontend-model `select({ModelName: [...]})` query payload support with model-aware serialization filtering (including nested preloads), and raise `AttributeNotSelectedError` when frontend code reads attributes that were not selected.
- Extract frontend model query-builder logic from `FrontendModelBase` into a dedicated `src/frontend-models/query.js` class to align frontend/backend query structure.
- Add frontend-model transport markers for `Date` and `undefined` values (`{__velocious_type: "date", value: ...}` / `{__velocious_type: "undefined"}`) with decode support on request and response paths.
- Extend frontend-model transport markers to preserve `bigint`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity` values across request/response JSON payloads.
- Harden frontend-model transport serialization/deserialization against `__proto__` prototype pollution by using null-prototype object accumulators.
- Add controller specs proving frontend model `index`, `find`, `update`, and `destroy` actions deny unauthorized records via resource ability scopes (`accessibleFor(...)`).
- Make frontend model commands raise on backend `{status: "error"}` responses so unauthorized `find`/`update`/`destroy` requests fail instead of being treated as success.
- Add dummy-app end-to-end frontend-model authorization integration tests using generated frontend models for denied `index`/`find`/`update`/`destroy` flows.
- Normalize route action-name resolution to treat slash-delimited actions like `current-user/update` as `currentUserUpdate`, with resolver + CLI normalization updates and regression coverage.
- Bump `@eslint/js` from `9.39.2` to `10.0.1` and `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` from `62.5.5` to `62.7.0`.
- Add `cause` when rethrowing errors in caught-error paths and remove useless initial assignments to satisfy ESLint 10 recommended rules (`preserve-caught-error`, `no-useless-assignment`).
- Add `FrontendModelBase.count()` / query `count()` for generated frontend models, returning the current index-query result size for model-first dashboard metrics.
- Add frontend-model query `search(path, column, operator, value)` support (`eq`/`notEq`/`gt`/`gteq`/`lt`/`lteq`) and apply `searches` payload filters in built-in `frontendIndex`.
- Add frontend-model query `where({attribute: value})` chaining support and apply `where` payload filters in built-in `frontendIndex`, enabling server-side filtering for `toArray()` flows.
- Revert sqlite web driver packaged wasm default and restore configurable `locateFile(file)` support, with default fallback to `https://sql.js.org/dist/<file>`.
- Add a `sqljs-wasm-route` plugin helper that serves `sql.js` dist assets from a Velocious backend route, plus `sqlJsLocateFileFromBackend(...)` helper for sqlite-web `locateFile` callbacks.
- Extend route resolver hooks to allow optional `controllerPath`/`viewPath` overrides so plugin-style libraries can resolve controllers outside app route directories.
- Add `Controller#sendFile(path, {contentType, status})` with streamed HTTP output so controllers can send files (for example wasm assets) without loading full files into memory first.
- Add `configuration.routes((routes) => ...)` plugin-route DSL with `routes.get`/`routes.post` and `to: [ControllerClass, action]` for simple plugin endpoint registration.
- Stabilize `Background jobs - queue` forked-job timing spec by waiting for a valid parsed JSON payload instead of only waiting for file existence, preventing intermittent `Unexpected end of JSON input` failures.
