## Purpose
This repo uses an automated “definition of done” for changes. Before declaring work complete, run the appropriate verification commands and fix any failures.

## Build output
`build/` contains compiled files generated by `npm run build`. Do not edit files under `build/` manually.

## Testing guidance
Prefer using the dummy app for tests instead of fake classes or stubbing.
For frontend-model runtime/query behavior, prefer `spec/frontend-models/base.http-integration-spec.js` and `spec/frontend-models/base.browser-spec.js` over unit-style coverage in `spec/frontend-models/base-spec.js`.
Prefer functional tests over raw SQL assertions because SQL varies by database. Only assert SQL when validating a query parser, and normalize it to avoid quoting differences.
Document newly discovered behavior, constraints, edge cases, and integration caveats in the `docs/` folder as part of normal development flow.
After changing base model generator logic, run `npx velocious g:base-models` from `spec/dummy` so the generated base models stay in sync.
`spec/dummy/db/structure-default.sql` is a generated schema snapshot; don't edit it manually, and commit updates when migrations/tests change it.
Always add tests for new or changed behavior.
Websocket channel callbacks should use `configuration.ensureConnections(...)` so existing async-context DB connections are reused; reserve `configuration.withConnections(...)` for creating new async-context connections when you truly need a fresh context (e.g., concurrent work).
Prefer `awaitery`'s `timeout` helper over manual `Promise.race` timeouts when a simple hard timeout is needed.
When editing `CHANGELOG.md`, append entries without creating new version headings (agents don't control releases).
When adding or changing features, update `README.md` with the relevant usage and behavior details.
Name specs that should run in browser tests with the `.browser-spec.js` suffix so the browser test runner includes them.
Use spaces inside named imports (e.g. `import {foo, bar} from "..."`).
Do not override methods on runtime instances to change behavior; add explicit hooks/flags in the owning class instead.
For multi-step method chains, put the receiver on its own line and place each chained call on its own following line.
In generated code, keep single-tag JSDoc blocks on one line when they fit (e.g. `/** @returns {Type} - Description. */`).
Do not silence JSDoc/TypeScript errors with broad casts like `/** @type {Record<string, any>} */ (...)`; fix the underlying typedefs/contracts instead.
For code that runs in Expo/Metro bundles, avoid non-literal dynamic imports (for example `import(variable)`); use static imports or environment-handler indirection.

## Verification commands

### Targeted checks (preferred)
Run only the relevant, changed, or new linters and tests locally:
- Always run `npm run lint` after changing any files.
- Use `npm run typecheck` when changes affect types.
- Use `npx velocious test <path-or-example>` for focused specs.
- Prefer adding or updating tests and running only those.
- Keep indentation consistent with the surrounding code.

### Quick check (fast)
Run as needed while iterating:

1) Lint
   `npm run lint`

2) Typecheck
   `npm run typecheck`

### Normal check (full validation, slower)
Skip full local suites; Peakflow will run the full test matrix for all database types on PRs.

If any command fails:
- Read the error output, fix the underlying issue, and re-run the same command.
- Repeat until the command succeeds (or clearly explain why it cannot be made to pass).

## PR description formatting
When editing PRs via CLI, use actual newlines in the body. Avoid literal `\n` sequences in the final description.

## When to run which check
- **Tiny change (docs/comments/non-functional formatting):** you may skip checks.
- **Most code changes:** run **Quick check** at least once while iterating.
- **Before final completion / ready for review:** run **Normal check**.

## Making tests faster while iterating (focus mode)

When iterating on tests, you may temporarily focus a subset of tests to speed up feedback.
This repo supports a `focus` argument on `describe` / `it` blocks:

### Focus a `describe`
```js
describe("something", {focus: true}, () => {
  // ...
})
```

### Focus an `it`
```js
describe("something", () => {
  it("sample", {focus: true}, () => {
    // ...
  })
})
```

## Pull requests
Use the `gh` CLI to open GitHub pull requests when needed.
Do not push to GitHub unless explicitly asked.

## Branches and commits
When asked to create branches and commit changes, come up with fitting branch names and commit messages. Split commits into smaller commits for each distinct change.
